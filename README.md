# SandIt
Fun project made in an effort to learn 2D Sand Pile Simulation, Godot Engine and a bit of C++.

## Attribution
Falling Sand Simulation is inspired by [sand-slide game](https://github.com/kiwijuice56/sand-slide)

Generating of mesh colliders for 2D phisics simulation is based on
- [cpp-marching-squares](https://github.com/reunanen/cpp-marching-squares)
- [douglas-peucker](https://gist.github.com/mieko/0275f2f4a3b18388ed5131b3364179fb#file-polygon-simplify-cc) implemented by [PieKing1215](https://github.com/PieKing1215) in his [FallingSandSurvival](https://github.com/PieKing1215/FallingSandSurvival/tree/dev/FallingSandSurvival/lib/douglas-peucker)
